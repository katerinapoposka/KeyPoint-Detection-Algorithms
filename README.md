# Computer Vision Algorithms Analysis

## Overview

This project explores various computer vision algorithms, focusing on their effectiveness in feature detection. Specifically, we analyze the performance of algorithms in detecting keypoints and edges in images.

## Criteria for Analysis

- **Invariance**: Does the algorithm maintain consistency despite transformations like rotation, scaling, and affine transformations?
- **Robustness**: How well does the algorithm handle occlusion, clutter, and changes in lighting?
- **Quantity**: Does the algorithm detect an adequate number of points to represent the image?
- **Time Complexity**: Is the algorithm efficient in terms of time?
